# Transparency-dev Incubator

A place for new transparency projects to be collaboratively developed before finding their forever homes, or being disbanded.
This is the logical successor to the value provided by [trillian-examples](https://github.com/google/trillian-examples), but now within the transparency-dev org.

Projects that are currently underway are:
 - [Verifiable Index](./vindex/): a verifiable index (map) built on top of a single Input Log
